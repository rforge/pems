Description: The R package pems.utils contains functions for the routine handling and analysis of 
   data from portable emissions measurement systems (PEMS) and other similar mobile monitoring 
   systems. The current version, pems.utils 0.2, includes functions for data reading and importing, 
   data cleanup, reformatting, alignment and merging, data visualization, screening and inspection, 
   conditioning and sub-sampling, summary statistics calculation and analysis, and batch-wise 
   analysis. The package also uses a dedicated 'pems' data class that manages many of the quality 
   control, unit handling and data archiving issues that can sometimes hinder efforts to standardize 
   PEMS research.
